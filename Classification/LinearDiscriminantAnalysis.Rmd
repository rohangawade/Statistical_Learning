```{r}
library(ISLR)
library(MASS)
attach(Smarket)
```
Using previous two days lags to predict what direction the stock will take.
```{r}
lda.fit = lda(Direction~Lag1+Lag2,data = Smarket,subset = Year<2005)
lda.fit
```
Prior probalities are almost 50% for up and down.

```{r}
plot(lda.fit)
```
Separately plots the LDA for two groups
```{r}
Smarket.2005 <- subset(Smarket, Year == 2005)
lda.pred <- predict(lda.fit,Smarket.2005)
class(lda.pred)
data.frame(lda.pred)[1:5,]
```

```{r}
table(lda.pred$class,Smarket.2005$Direction)
```

```{r}
mean(lda.pred$class==Smarket.2005$Direction)
```
